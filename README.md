The Key Differences between the usage of Bike Rides of casual users and members are:

1.	Casual users ride duration are
significantly longer, they are almost double that of member’s ride duration. Whereas
the frequency of use of members are more.

2.	Casual Riders mostly ride on the weekends
and Members ride mostly on the weekdays. Which helps us to identify that the
purpose of ride of Members are mostly work and casual’s recreation.

3.	Summer is the peak time for the both
the riders. In winter the casual riders decline but the members not much


The Marketing Plan can be designed in the following way

1.	Make the pricing package more convenient
for casual riders. Casual riders like long rides so 45 minutes unlimited
package isn’t enough, it needs to be longer

2.	Target the casual riders who
frequently ride in weekdays to go to work or school. Make them feel that it is
more convenient to become a annual member.

3.	Design Marketing campaigns targeting
the weekend casual riders. Make attractive promotion
